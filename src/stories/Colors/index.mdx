# Colors

## How to use Colors ?

There are multiples ways for you to use the colors

### 1. CSS Variables (Recommended approach. Comes with auto-theming)

Following color variables will be added to the `:root` of your document. These variables will automatically switch its value
based on the current theme that you are using

```scss
--background-primary-50,
--background-primary-100,
--background-primary-900
```

### 2. SCSS Variables

You can use the exported `style-dictionary/colors.scss` file from the library with the below approach. Please note that these variables are just
static values and you will need to manage theming support on your own if you use this.

### Variables defined in `_colors.scss`

```scss
/**
 * Do not edit directly, this file was auto-generated.
 */

$colors: (
  'color-semantics-light-background-primary-50': #000000,
  'color-semantics-light-background-primary-100': #acacac,
  'color-semantics-light-background-primary-900': #ffffff,
  'color-semantics-dark-background-primary-50': #ffffff,
  'color-semantics-dark-background-primary-100': #acacac,
  'color-semantics-dark-background-primary-900': #000000,
);
```
